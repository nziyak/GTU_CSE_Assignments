hi, i will shortly introduce what is working in my code and what is not for your easiness and fair grading.
i could not write histogram function.
read_text and read_dict functions are working well and returning the word number in attached files well.
if you enter one or more words which are in input.txt, their occurence number will be printed well.
if you enter one or more words which are not in the input.txt but in the dictionary.txt, their closest words will be printed
with their occurence times in the input.txt
